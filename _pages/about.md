I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of AI](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/), [XIDIAN University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by by [Miles Silman](https://biology.wfu.edu/faculty-research/miles-silman/), [V. Pa√∫l Pauca](https://paucavp.sites.wfu.edu/), and [Bob Nations](https://counseling.graduate.wfu.edu/faculty-staff/dr-bob-nations/) on a project named "Real-Time Detection, Segmentation, and Counting of Palms with UAV Imagery in Ecuadorian Rainforests", which has been submitted to AAAI 2025.
Previously, I was supervised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=wangc6&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) at the [School of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), [SUSTech University](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), on Gaussian-Splatting related work.
