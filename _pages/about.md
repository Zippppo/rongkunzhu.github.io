I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of AI](https://sai.xidian.edu.cn/), [XIDIAN University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chao Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=wangc6&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1) from [School of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/), [SUSTech University](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I was advised by [Prof. XX]() from [School of Computer Science](), Peking University.
